# Tutorial for dynamical mean-field theory using exact-diagonalization solver

This is a dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) tutorial for 2024 Strongly correlated physics â€“ Numerical and Analytical approaches at National Yang-Ming Chiao-Tung University and National Center of Theoretical Science, Taiwan. In this tutorial, you will learn how to implement DMFT using the exact-diagonalization (ED) as an impurity solver. The repository contains three folders.

(i) metal: This folder contains a jupyter notebook "dmft-ed-metal.ipynb" implementing the DMFT loop to investigate the correlated metal behavior. The code shows the behavior of the Green's function and self-energy on the real frequency and Matsubara frequency. The script "dos.py" contains a simple semicricular density of state of Bethe lattice. The srcipt "ed.py" is a simple but less efficient implementation of the exact-diagonalization algorithm for solving the Anderson impurity model.

(ii) mott: This folder is similar to the metal folder, but it applies the DMFT to Mott insulating solution and shows the behavior of the Green's function and self-energy on the real frequency and Matsubara frequency.

(iii) metal_mott_transition: This folder applies the DMFT to investigate the first-order metal-Mott-insulator transition at half-filling. In order to investigate the first-order transition, we run the DMFT calculations from small Coulomb interaction U to large U (the metal2mott folder with "dmft-ed-metal2mott.ipynb") as well as from large U to small U (the mott2metal folder with "dmft-ed-mott2metal.ipynb"). Then, we plot the hysteresis curves of the first order transition (in "dmft-ed-metal2mott.ipynb") showing in the double-occupanc vs. U and the qusiparticle weight Z vs. U figures. The density of state as a function of U is also plotted.

Optional homework:

(iv) Can you reproduce the finite temperature phase diagram of the DMFT metal-insulator transition using the provided code?
